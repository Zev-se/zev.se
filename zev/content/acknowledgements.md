# Acknowledgements

It's often forgotten how simple yet nice it is to say thanks so here's my page of exactly that. If you find yourself on this list, feel free to use it, I'm happy to be a reference. If you find someone on this list and have questions please contact me.

## Webpage

I wrote a blogpost on how I started using static sites, it can be found HERE <TODO>. The site is built with GoHugo and the theme is based on hugo-coder.
