# Acknowledgements

It's often forgotten how simple yet nice it is to say thanks so here's my page of exactly that. If you find yourself on this list, feel free to use it, I'm happy to be a reference. If you find someone on this list and have questions please contact me.

## Webpage

First of all I wrote a blogpost on how I started using static sites, it can be found HERE <TODO>. In short however thanks to @jonse and AAD for helping me get started. I would also like to thank @HUGO and @HUGO-CODER, it's the static site generator and the base most of this website is built on. Without it this site would probably either never had existed or at least been less nice looking.
