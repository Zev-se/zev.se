You may very well wonder what this is, why it exists and why no one proof read the posts before they are published. Although I'm also annoyed when I find typos this is my project of trying to fight perfect. There are many ways to put it, perfect is the enemy of good, the 80/20 rule or done is better then perfect. In other words this is a way for me to get better at releasing stuff I made because they are good enough but not neccesarly finished. To not over complicate. Therefore text might contain typos, pictures not edited well enough, code longer then needed. As always feedback is welcome, so if you find mistakes or have other feedback please reach out to me, I'm not affraid of improving my work.2
