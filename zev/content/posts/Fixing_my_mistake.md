When I built my Voron I messed up and missed that deck panel was suppsed to be black and that what I mounted to the underside whas really the nice side, covered by protective film. If not removing all electronics from the DIN-rails and unmounting the heated bed was difficult to do once I've now done it twice just to make sure. However the result is really worth it. Here's some before and after:

*Notice how the deck panel is ugly grey silverish.*

*Note the plastic cover with chineese writing on it.*

Bonus tip, if you print ![these](https://www.printables.com/model/411428-voron-24-flex-plate-stops) and mount them before removing the heated bed it will be much easier to remount in the correct place later. Removing the heated bed isn't strictly nessesary but my cables for the Nevermore is a bit short so I needed to remove the bed to reconnect them.
